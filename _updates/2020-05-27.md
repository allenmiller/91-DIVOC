- Added "Cumulative Mortality Rate" to all graphs, allowing you to view the current mortality rate for every country/state.
- Added "Test Positivity" to the normalized graphs (which is identical in display to the non-normalized graphs).
- UI Fix: The display of "X Days Ago" should only show a whole number.
- Redesigned the "Explore 91-DIVOC" box between the visualizations.
