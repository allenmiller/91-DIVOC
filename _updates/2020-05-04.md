- Created individual pages for each graph, useful for devices that run out of memory rendering all of the graphs:
  * [Raw Data by Country](/pages/covid-visualization/countries.html)
  * [Raw Data by State](/pages/covid-visualization/states.html)
  * [Population Normalized Data by Country](/pages/covid-visualization/countries-normalized.html)
  * [Population Normalized Data by State](/pages/covid-visualization/states-normalized.html)
- All pages uses the same JavaScript, so updates to one will update them all! :)
