- Added "Y-Axis" option "Scale to Max Value". This will scale your y-axis value to the current maximum value, which will help for graphs with high outliers that crowd the rest of the data into a small portion in the graph.
- The "Show": "Top 10/Top 25/etc" US graphs will no longer show regions, only states.

- Changed default to right-align to view same-day comparisons of US states.  Left-align still available in "X-Axis" options.
- Chrome-specific Fix: The graph will now display the options Chrome "remembers" for you in your drop-down selections (instead of using the default values), which will fix a UI display bug for Chrome users who arrive at the page via a back/forward button.
