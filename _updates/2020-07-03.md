I have always wanted to keep [#02: COVID-19 Data for Locations of People You Love](/pages/covid-by-your-locations/) simple and I use it daily to provide an overview of the locations of my family and my closest friends.  Lately, however, I have found that the tool wasn't finding it was providing trend data -- are cases increasing or decreasing, and by how much?

The latest enhancement fixes that:

- Added a 14/28-day (dependent on screen size) chart to ["COVID-19 Data for Locations of People You Love"](/pages/covid-by-your-locations/) to show the history of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the cities/counties you care about the most.
