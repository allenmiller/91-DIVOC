- Added "Test Positivity Data" to graph of US States.
- Added a small note below the graph when all highlighted data appears only in the lowest 1/3rd of the graph to suggest scaling y-axis to highlight.
- Changed default view of states to "US States" instead of "All" (hiding territories by default).
