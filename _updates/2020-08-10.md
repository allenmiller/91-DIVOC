In the original release of [91-DIVOC #02: "COVID-19 Data for Locations of People You Love"](/pages/covid-by-your-locations/), the number of new cases were represented by a percentage increase over the past week.  As COVID-19 has continued, this one-week metric is less and less relevant and has been replaced with population-normalized statistics to allow a better perspective on COVID-19 in various locations:

- Added a new line showing the number of cases /100k people in each location.  For example:
  - Champaign, Illinois has "**+59.61** new cases /100,000 people in the past week (+125)"
  - New York City that has "**+25.3** new cases /100,000 people in the past week (+2109)"
