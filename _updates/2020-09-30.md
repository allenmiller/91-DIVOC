In the early days of the COVID era, [The Holy See (Vatican City)](https://91-divoc.com/pages/covid-visualization/?chart=countries-normalized&highlight=Holy%20See&show=25&y=both&scale=linear&data=cases-daily-7&data-source=jhu&xaxis=left#countries-normalized) confirmed 3 cases on March 24th, 2 more on March 28th, and another 5 cases in April.  At that time, the Holy See dominated the normalized cases having an official population of just 799 residents.

As part of today's update, I removed this filter completely -- the normalized data no longer filters small countries.  This is notable as Johns Hopkins University tracks the microstate of Andorra [(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andorra) -- with a ~100 new cases and a population of 77,543, Andorra has been the location of one of fastest spread of COVID-19 on a population-normalized basis [(91-DIVOC Graph)](https://91-divoc.com/pages/covid-visualization/?chart=countries-normalized&highlight=Andorra&show=25&y=both&scale=linear&data=cases-daily-7&data-source=jhu&xaxis=left#countries-normalized).

Additionally, a few tooltips were cleaned up.  Look for a brand new visualization tomorrow! :)
