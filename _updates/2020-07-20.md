- Added a new algorithm to allow labels to be dynamically moved (slightly) to minimize the overlap of labels to increase readability.
- Using Shift+Click to add an additional highlight now updates your custom link immediately.
- Improved scaling when "(None)" is selected as the highlight option.
- Backend updates for 91-DIVOC #05 launch tomorrow! :)
