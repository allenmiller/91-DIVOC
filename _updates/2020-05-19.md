- Added this feature as small text on the bottom of non-mobile tooltips.
- Added several options for "Show" on US state graphs.
  - Region-based categories are based on the [Census Bureau-designated regions and divisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regions_of_the_United_States#Census_Bureau-designated_regions_and_divisions).
