- Added a global "Data Source" selection allowing you to select your data source.
- Refactored the use of [Johns Hopkins Data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) as a data source.
- Added [The COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/api) as a data source.
- Added a new URL parameter (`data-source`) to store the data source logic.

- Improved the "7-day average" for ratios (test positivity, mortality rate) to take 7 days of underlying data instead of averaging 7 one-day values.
