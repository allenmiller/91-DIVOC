Starting a bit over a month ago, Johns Hopkins University has stopped reporting any state-level hospitalization data (you can see [the empty column in their raw data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports_us/10-14-2020.csv)).  Fortunately, the COVID Tracking Project by The Atlantic continues to report this data and, when choosing state-level hospitalization data graphs, you are prompted to select the COVID Tracking Project data source to view the data.  (It appears they're not tracking every state, but they're getting data from the majority of the states.)

Additionally, the mobile layout labels were getting extremely cluttered -- the latest update cleans up the spacing on x-axis labels when viewing the visualization on a mobile layout. ðŸŽ‰
