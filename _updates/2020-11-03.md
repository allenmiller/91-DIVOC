title: Fixed Daylight Savings Display Bug
date: 2020-11-03

In all of the 91-DIVOC visualizations, I assumed a day had 24 hours -- which wasn't the case this past weekend for most of the United States.  For users where a day was 25 hours due to daylight savings time, a visual jump appeared in the chart going from "0 days ago" to "2 days ago".  This is now fixed. :)
