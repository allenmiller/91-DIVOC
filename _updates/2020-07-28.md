- Added population-normalized information.  Specifically:
  - For confirmed cases, the percentage of the population within the county/city that has had a confirmed case of COVID-19.
  - For deaths, the deaths per 100,000 residents.

- Improved loading time by removing unnecessary code. 
- This implements [suggestion #36 on the 91-DIOOC github](https://github.com/wadefagen/91-DIVOC/issues/36)
