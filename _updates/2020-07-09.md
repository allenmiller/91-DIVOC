The most recent update enhances the region selections -- we can explore now, for example, how the United States might compare to various WHO regions as a whole.

- Added new global regions based on the [World Health Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHO_regions) designated regions. 
- Added a new "Show" selection to show only the regions for a specific graph (ex: WHO, US regions, etc).


Additionally, the code was refactored to allow for better exploration of regions in future updates:

- Refactored the region code to allow for code-defined regions (instead of defining the regions in pre-processing).  In a future update, this can be expanded to allow for "custom regions".
- Removed the "Exclude NY/NJ/CT" region in favor of future custom regions.
- Updated "Change Log" code to allow images to point to specific graphs instead of just the visualization.
