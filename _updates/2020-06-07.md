- Added "Global" as a data point for the world visualizations
- Added "Europe" based on the [World Health Organization EURO region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHO_regions).
- Improved label placement logic for countries outside of the range of the visualization (eg: "Global")
- Improved additional highlight display logic (will now show the range of the longest highlight)
- Fixed sorting of countries for "Top/Bottom X" on normalized graphs
