- Allowed the display of "log-scale" graphs on percentage graphs (ex: test positivity, case fatality rates).
- Improved the title on normalized percentage graphs ("test positivity" is never normalized, as it's a percentage).
- Wrote a article, ["Minimizing Overlapping Labels in Interactive Visualizations"](https://towardsdatascience.com/minimizing-overlapping-labels-in-interactive-visualizations-b0eabd62ef0), for Towards Data Science about the new label layout algorithms for the right-align graphs.
