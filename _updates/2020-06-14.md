- Non-highlighted data points now render fewer mouseover circles for data over a month old.  Even fewer for data over two months old.
  - The line will always be correct, using every daily data point.
  - Highlighted data will always render all circles.
  - This should significantly speed up rendering time for the graphs.

- Added US regions to US graphs based on the [United States Census Bureau's regions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Census_Bureau): "US-South", "US-Midwest", "US-Northeast", and "US-West".
- Improved calculation of "Global" when using Johns Hopkins Data.
