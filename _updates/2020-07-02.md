- Added new feature: "+Add Additional Data" to show additional data in the same visualization.
  - You can to overlay single-day data on top of the seven-day rolling average (using "Scale Using Graph Units")
  - You can also overlay completely different data to see if there's a correlation between two different pieces of data (using "Scale Separately")

- Added logic to store your processed data to speed up the visualization when processing data you've processed previously.
  - Previously, if you change the "Data" from "New Cases" to "New Deaths" and then back to "New Cases", the graph re-processed all of the data.  This is no longer required and should significantly speed up the visualization. :)

- Renamed "Y-Axis" value of "Fixed" to a more descriptive name "Scale to All-time Max".
