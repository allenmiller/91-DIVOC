Animations can now be saved right in your web browser!

- Added new "Save" options: GIF and WebM.

  - GIF takes a bit longer to encode and may sometimes be of lower quality, but should work on almost all web browsers.
  - WebM is a open video format that is just starting to see wide-spread adoption.  WebM should work on Chrome, but may fail on other browsers.


In addition, the saving of PNG images also improved:

- PNG images now save a "Desktop-sized" chart that is sized better for sharing, instead of the mobile view.
- PNG images now include the chart header instead of just the graph.
- (These changes also appear in the animation creation above.)


Additional Improvements:

- Added a "Cancel" button to interrupt the rendering.
