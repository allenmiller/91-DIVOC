Added several new data selections:

- "Derivative Charts" that show the change of the daily cases.  A positive derivative indicates that the there is currently the daily cases are increasing at an increasing rate, a zero derivative indicates that there is no change in daily cases (the same number of new cases were detected yesterday and today), and a negative derivative indicates that there is a deceasing number of new daily cases (fewer new cases were detected today than yesterday).

- "Experimental Charts" that are playing around with non-transitional charts (mostly out of request from others).  The current two show a the current case fatality rate using a 2-week or 4-week lagged number of cases.
