- Improved mouseover tooltip display of decimal places for states/countries with very small numbers (ex: Japan, normalized by population).  The number of decimals shown is now based on the magnitude of the data.  ([Suggested on @ernest-tg on github#51](https://github.com/wadefagen/91-DIVOC/issues/51).)

- Improved the code used to save the image as a PNG in preparation for future features.
