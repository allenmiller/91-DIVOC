- Added new "Highlight" option, "(None, without dimming)" to show all of the data without the non-highlight opacity filter applied.
- Non-highlighted data lines will now stay the same color when animated (from [#57](https://github.com/wadefagen/91-DIVOC/issues/57) from [@kidinthehall](https://github.com/kidinthehall)).
