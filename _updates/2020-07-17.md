This is the most significant update to 91-DIVOC in quite some time, adding a new data source from [Our World in Data (Oxford University, et al)](https://ourworldindata.org/).  The Our World in Data dataset provides testing data for a number of global countries, allowing for "COVID-19 Tests" and "Test Positivity" in the "Data" selection on the countries graph, and other changes:

- Added testing and test positivity to the countries graph.
- Added new "Y-Axis" option: "Current Highlight Value".
- Renamed the "Y-Axis" options to make what they do a little more clear.
- Added "X-Axis" option "Days Ago, recent 12 weeks".


As part of working with Our World in Data, a few bugs were fixed and other minor display changes:

- The date now displays as "YYYY-MM-DD" (ex: 2020-07-17) instead of "MM-DD-YYYY".
- Tooltips now show the correct data when mousing over a multi-day average (ex: 1 week, or 1 month average).


The default data selection is now "Johns Hopkins & Our World in Data", using Our World in Data for the countries graph and Johns Hopkins for the United States data.  The data source will always be displayed at the bottom of the graph.
