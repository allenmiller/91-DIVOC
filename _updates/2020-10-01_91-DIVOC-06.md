The University of Illinois has been widely reported in national media for testing every single student twice a week -- how are they doing?  How do they compare to their peer schools within the Big Ten Conference?

The newest 91-DIVOC visualization explores [COVID-19 at Big Ten Conference Schools](/pages/covid-19-at-big-ten-conference-schools/), tracking the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, total COVID-19 tests administered, and the test positivity.

As with all of the visualization, the visualization is updated daily. :)
