- Added information on the current processing task when the graphs are in a loading state.
- Slightly optimized the data processing.

- Added new option "+Add US State" to the country graphs.
  - This allows you to compare, for example, Sweden vs. California vs. Texas normalized by population.
- Now displaying "Georgia" (the country in Europe) as "Georgia (EU)" to avoid the name conflict with the US state.
