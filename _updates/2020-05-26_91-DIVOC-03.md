  It feels like both a decade ago and just yesterday that the first 91-DIVOC visualization was released.  It has been a humbling and rewarding
  experience to have millions view it and, to this date, I still find it the best way to nerd out with the data.  It's been fantastic to also
  see some building spin-offs of it to use it for other datasets!
</p>

<p>
  There has been so many amazing COVID-19 visualizations -- but I have yet to see one that puts all of the case data that's available
  in real <b>human</b> terms?  So much of the data is bar charts, line charts, and just charts, charts, and charts.

  This visualization is one of the simplest in terms of elements, just a single person, but rendered in a way
  that expresses the human impact and human scale of COVID-19.  In some ways it's a simpler view of 91-DIVOC-01, but in other ways
  it's so much more powerful:

  The SVG image was slightly modified, public domain image I found on Wikipedia and served as part of the inspiration for this work.
  Limiting the entire visualization to a single graphic was both challenging but rewarding, and something I hope you'd try out!  Go
  start creating something &ndash; it only takes on graphic to make something great! :)
