In all of these visualizations, I created visualizations that helped me make sense of the COVID-19 data.  At this point, I can spend hours diving into the data and there's few questions that I am unable to answer using 91-DIVOC graphs.  Therefore, for the next week, I'm looking to explore better documentation of this tool, fix any remaining bugs, and focus on quality improvements.  As part of this, I have already:

- Resolved or labeled all issues and pull requests on the [91-DIVOC github page](https://github.com/wadefagen/91-DIVOC).
- Created a [guide](/pages/interactive-visualziation-of-covid-19-in-illinois/guide/) for the Illinois-specific visualization detailing the various features of the visualization.
- Fixed several bugs that were brought to my attention via e-mail.

Additionally, I've started some initial work on some visualizations beyond COVID-19.  If you'd like to get a once-a-month update on data-forward visualizations, I [have an e-mail list](https://forms.gle/oLXWdijmr9i2Yxau9) that I'll be  providing a monthly update of all the latest visualizations to nerd out with.

Let me know if you find any bugs and thanks for all the support! :)
